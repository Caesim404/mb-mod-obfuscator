Compresses and obfuscates Mount&Blade module *.txt files.

This does not make it impossible to decompile your module. But it does make it a harder task. It also helps prevent editing by hand.


Requires Python 2.
Options are inside obfuscate.py.

It writes the obfuscated files to the same directory the *.txt files were. That means the original files are written over.

For easiest use, simply copy it to same directory as your MB source files are and run it.
It will auto detect *.txt location based on modules_info.py.
